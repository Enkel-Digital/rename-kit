# rename-kit
Rename file extensions with this CLI tool.  
This is just a random project I did on a day to rename my own files...  
I know that you can do the same with something like [ren](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9885241/changing-all-files-extensions-in-a-folder-with-one-command-on-windows) on windows or [mv/rename](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/19654/how-do-i-change-the-extension-of-multiple-files) on *nix shells.  
But hey... I just wanted to do it and kinda did it so... try it out I guess?

So this package is both a CLI tool and a library. Where you can use the installed binary directly to rename files, or use it as a dependency to wrap and build your app with the exposed API.
